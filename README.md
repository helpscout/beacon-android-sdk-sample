## Documentation

The main SDK documentation is hosted on the [Help Scout developers site](https://developer.helpscout.com/beacon-2/android/). 

## Requirements

The minimum supported SDK is **21** (Android 5.0), and your app must be compiled with at least API version **27** (Android 8.1).

The Beacon SDK only needs Internet permission which is defined in the Core module.

## Installation
The Beacon Android SDK is distributed as AAR and available from JCenter, so simply add the following lines to your app’s `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation "com.helpscout:beacon-core:$beaconVersion"
  implementation "com.helpscout:beacon-ui:$beaconVersion"
}
```

Once you sync the Gradle project you'll be ready to initialize Beacon.


# Initialize Beacon

After following the steps above, your app is set up for integrating with the Beacon SDK. Before you can continue any further, you'll need to get hold of the ID of the Beacon that you'd like to integrate with.

You can find your Beacon ID by [logging into Help Scout](https://secure.helpscout.net/settings/beacons) and navigating to the Beacon you'd like to use. Inside the `Installation` section you'll see an Android tab which highlights the Beacon ID and a code snippet.

Once you've located the Beacon ID, you are ready to initialise the library. If you will only display one Beacon, the `Application.onCreate()` method of your [Application class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html)
class is a great place to initialize the SDK. If you won't know the Beacon ID at Application start, or will be running multiple Beacons, you'll need to make sure of adding
 the following call to the `Beacon.Builder()` before you launch `BeaconActivity`.  

```java
Beacon beacon = new Beacon.Builder()
  .withBeaconId("76d18b11-41f4-4d34-9a8c-08679d4759e3")       
  .build();
```

Beacon ID field is mandatory. Failing to provide it will throw an `SDKInitException`
when an interaction with the `Beacon` object is done.

## Launching the Beacon User Interface

Once you’ve initialized Beacon, you’re ready to interact with it. Whenever you want
to invoke Beacon, use the code below to display the Beacon user interface.

```java
BeaconActivity.open(context);
```

We've put together several [sample demo projects](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon-android-sdk-sample/tree/master/sample-kotlin) that showcase how you can integrate with Beacon SDK and launch the Beacon User Interface.


## Advance setup/configuration

There are three main components that construct the Beacon SDK that are split over two modules.

* beacon-core
    - Beacon Builder -  `Beacon.Builder()`  
    - Public Data Layer - `BeaconRepository`

* beacon-ui
    - Easiest way to integrate Beacon features into your app

## Developer options

It's possible to launch the Beacon SDK in developer mode. By doing so, you'll be able to read
the HTTP requests and other actions that happen with the SDK realm.

In order to activate this mode, you have to tell the Beacon Builder like so:

```java
Beacon beacon = Beacon.Builder()
  .withBeaconId("cf2102b5-0f3c-4214-972e-2a1d33c7fadb")       
  .withLogsEnabled(true)       
  .build();
```

Once this is done, head over to LogCat.


## Implementing your own User Interface

If all you are looking to do is to expose the knowledge database of articles, the Public API mode is your best bet.
We have provided you with a `Repository` (you can read more about this pattern [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649690.aspx). You'll only need to include the `core` dependency.

The only requirement is to have created a `Beacon` with the `Beacon.Builder` as described above.

```java
BeaconRepository repository = Beacon.getRepositoryInstance()
```

This `Repository` allows you to fetch a few collections:

### Exposed methods

- Fetch all articles article by id: `List<BeaconArticle> articles = repository.getArticles()`
- Fetch an article by id: `BeaconArticle article = repository.getArticleById(articleId)`
- Search for an article: `List<BeaconArticle> articles = repository.searchArticles(query)`

### Threading

All the calls made to the `BeaconRepository` are synchronous. Meaning that you'll have to provide a threading
mechanism. Instead of being opinionated about it, we prefer to give you the option to use whatever mechanism works
best for you.

There's also a demo project that [shows how to build your own](https://github.com/helpscout/beacon-android-sdk-sample/tree/master/sample-core) User Interface
